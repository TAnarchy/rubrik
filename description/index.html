          <p>Rubrik is a simple, in-browser interface for creating grading rubrics and grading homework and tests against them.</p>
          
          <p>Some searching reveals that no tools exist specifically for this job, so traditionally, generic tools like spreadsheets have been used for this purpose, but they don&#8217;t have the specific focus needed to provide useful features or a reasonable interface. Professors and TAs copy around templates, accidentally including one student&#8217;s grades in another, provide no workflow management, and are extremely prone to &#8220;off-by-one-cell&#8221; errors.</p>
          
          <p>Rubrik is built from the ground up to perform this one task intelligently, promoting fair and accurate grading (with efficient, stress-free workflows built-in to provide for differently-styled graders), as well as clear problem statements and requirements to make sure students understand the assignment.</p>
          
          <p>Rubrik makes the physical grading process easier, and makes students certain of their performance.</p>
        </div>
        <h2 id='concept'>Concept</h2>
        <div>
          <p>Before an assignment is given, Rubrik helps the professor create clear multi-part problem statements with precise scoring systems. These problem statements can be outputted in several formats, such as a separate, itemized rubric or inline &#8220;possible points&#8221; annotations, and with an adjustable level of specificity. The source rubric may contain extra details not shown to the students, thus requiring some amount of creativity.</p>
          
          <p>At grading time, Rubrik provides the grader with a clear interface, prompting her with each task to be asserted in the assignment, to be marked as complete or not, with optional partial credit and extra annotations, or without input (if the grades are to be marked directly on paper). These tasks can be grouped in many ways, displayed individually or several at a time, and assignments can be interleaved to help maintain grading consistency between students.</p>
          
          <p>Afterward, Rubrik provides concise output formats for score presentation, automatically computes a variety of useful statistics (mean, median, variance, min, max), and provides facilities for distributing these grades (automatic emailing, blackboard integration). It also stores grades securely, updates course-long (weighted) grade averages, and allows for curved or non-curved grading schemes.</p>
